    "\n",
    "In this session, we discussed enhancing your chatbot project by incorporating character-specific Markov chains. The key idea is to modify your existing Markov chain implementation to handle separate Markov models for different characters. Each character will have their own unique set of word transitions or bigrams based on their dialogue style, leading to more tailored and distinct responses depending on which character is speaking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Character-Specific Markov Chains:\n",
    "\n",
    "You extend the chatbot to track which character is speaking and generate a Markov chain model specific to each one.\n",
    "For each character, the program maintains a unique word transition probability matrix, constructed from their respective dialogues.\n",
    "When generating responses, the chatbot uses the model associated with the current character to predict the next word or phrase.\n",
    "Implementation Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a data structure (e.g., a dictionary) where the key is the character's name, and the value is their corresponding Markov chain model.\n",
    "For each character, the model is built based on their dialogue history, using bigrams or higher-order n-grams if needed.\n",
    "When the chatbot needs to respond, it identifies the character and uses the appropriate model to generate contextually relevant text.\n",
    "This approach creates a more dynamic and realistic interaction experience as each character has a distinct way of responding, based on their own personalized Markov chain.\n",
